##                                            Loan Prediction


Within this dataset for Loan Status Prediction, we have records of applicants who previously sought loans, specifically for Property Loans.

The bank assesses various factors such as Applicant Income, Loan Amount, prior Credit History, Co-applicant Income, etc., to determine loan approval.

Our objective is to develop a Machine Learning Model that can predict whether an applicant's loan will be approved or rejected.

In this project, we aim to classify individuals based on factors like Income, Education, Work Experience, previous Loan history, and more, to ascertain their eligibility for a loan amount.
